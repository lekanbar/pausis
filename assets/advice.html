<p style="color:#0099ff;">Smoking and Ovarian Reserve</p>
<hr width="100%" color="#CC00CC">
<p>
It is common knowledge that smoking cigarettes is bad for a person’s general health. More specifically,
smoking can have a detrimental effect on a woman’s reproductive health. It is a fact that infertility or
difficulty conceiving is more common among women who smoke <sup><a href="http://www.asrm.org/uploadedFiles/ASRM_Content/Resources/Patient_Resources/Fact_Sheets_and_I
nfo_Booklets/smoking.pdf">1</a></sup>. Many scientific studies have shown that
on average, women who smoke have an earlier menopause <sup>2,3,4</sup>. An analysis of several of these studies
found that women who smoked cigarettes went through the menopause 0.8-1.7 years earlier (on average)
than women who were not current smokers <sup>2</sup>. It has been suggested that this earlier menopause happens
because smoking causes the ovaries to run out of oocytes (eggs) faster than they would normally (as a
woman gets older), although the mechanism for this is uncertain at the moment. Anti-Mullerian hormone
(AMH) is a hormone often used by doctors to estimate the number of oocytes (eggs) in a woman’s ovaries
(i.e. her ovarian reserve) – the higher the AMH value, the greater the ovarian reserve <sup>5</sup>. A more recent study
showed significantly reduced AMH levels in women aged 38-50 who were smokers, compared with women
of the same age who were not smokers <sup>5</sup>, suggesting that the smokers had fewer oocytes left in their
ovaries than the non-smokers. This study did not find significantly lower AMH levels in women who were
former smokers <sup>5</sup>. Therefore, if a woman is trying to get pregnant or wants to have children in the future,
especially if she is older, it seems that stopping smoking could increase her chances of conceiving before
going through the menopause.

The focus of this app is trying to estimate ovarian reserve (i.e. the number of eggs that a woman has left in
her ovaries). However, if a woman is trying to get pregnant, it is definitely advisable to stop smoking, not
only because continuing to smoke might make it more difficult to conceive, but because of the many
problems associated with smoking in pregnancy1. Pregnant smokers have an increased risk of:

<ul>
<li> Having a miscarriage <sup><a href="http://www.asrm.org/uploadedFiles/ASRM_Content/Resources/Patient_Resources/Fact_Sheets_and_I

<li>Having an ectopic pregnancy (possibly) <sup><a href="http://www.asrm.org/uploadedFiles/ASRM_Content/Resources/Patient_Resources/Fact_Sheets_and_I

<li>Going into premature labour <sup><a href="http://www.asrm.org/uploadedFiles/ASRM_Content/Resources/Patient_Resources/Fact_Sheets_and_I

<li>Having a baby with a low birth weight <sup><a href="http://www.asrm.org/uploadedFiles/ASRM_Content/Resources/Patient_Resources/Fact_Sheets_and_I

</ul>

Also, babies living in a house with someone who smokes have a higher risk of sudden infant death
syndrome (SIDS) or ‘cot death’ <sup><a href="http://www.asrm.org/uploadedFiles/ASRM_Content/Resources/Patient_Resources/Fact_Sheets_and_I
