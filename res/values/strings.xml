    <string name="mmagevaluetext">"Menopause typically occurs at age 50-51 years, but there is a large range. Menopause before age 45 is early menopause, and menopause before age 40 is known as Premature Ovarian Insufficiency (POI).
        \n\n
        There is substantial evidence that genetic factors play a major role in determining a woman’s age at menopause. 
        It is likely that this influence is exerted through an effect on ovarian reserve. 
        One of the most frequently studied areas is the association between mothers’ and daughters’ ages at menopause. 
        Since mothers and daughters share 50% of their genes, if age at menopause is affected by genetic factors, 
        it is likely that a significant correlation would exist between mothers’ and daughters’ ages at menopause. Based on the research in this \u0020"</string>
    <string name="mmagevaluetext2">the heritability of menopausal age was 44%, which is quite significant in knowing the ovarian reserve levels.</string>

    <string name="fshvaluetext">"Follicle-stimulating Hormone (FSH) is a hormone that stimulates the growth of egg follicles, therefore it plays a vital role in helping to determine your fertility.
     \n
     Any FSH value below 10 International Units per Litre (IU/L) is within normal ranges. 
     
     Elevated FSH indicates that your are either menopausal or approaching the menopause. What elevated means depends on where in the cycle the FSH measurement was taken.     
     
     \n If the measurement was taken in the <b>Early Follicular Phase</b> (typically day three to five, counted from last menstruation), then any value over 10 IU/L is elevated, indicating approach of the menopause.
     \n
     If the measurement is taken at any other time during the cycle, then a value over 25 IU/L is elevated.

    <string name="afcvaluetext">"Antral Follicles are developing ovarian follicles that have grown so large that they can be seen in ultrasound scans. 
        \n
 Your Antral Follicle Count (AFC) is the number found on a scan of your ovary. 
 \n
 A high AFC indicates that you have an active ovary that has many follicles developing towards being eggs that can be fertilized. For this reason an average or high AFC is often taken as an indication of good fertility, and low AFCs may indicate fertility problems. 
 \n
 AFCs will change every month or so, since the ovaries are not generally active at exactly the same rate. So a low AFC in one scan may be just bad luck, with later scans showing higher, more normal, AFCs. Conversely, a high AFC might just be good luck, so if at all possible, you should have more than one scan taken.

    <string name="ngfvalue">Your remaining Ovarian Reserve</string>
    <string name="ngfvaluetext">"The cells that can become eggs are called non-growing follicles (<b>NGFs</b> for short). You were born with a fixed number of NGFs in your ovaries, this is your <b>Ovarian Reserve</b>. Typically there are about 400,000 in each ovary, but there is a large amount of variation so you could have been born with between 70,000 and 3 million NGFs.
         \n
There is a cycle that recruits some NGFs which grow into bigger and bigger follicles, but most of them die during the cycle. Only very few (about 400 for your whole reproductive lifespan) turn into eggs that can be fertilized.
        \n
It is believed that women who start with a high Ovarian Reserve lose NGFs quickly and women who have a low Ovarian Reserve lose NGFs slowly. This is because menopause happens for all women when there are about 1,000 NGFs left at an average age of 51 years.
         \n
This enables us to estimate the percentage of NGFs remaining for a woman of any age. The estimates are based on the Wallace-Kelsey model of NGF populations throughout life. Click on the link below to read the <b>Science behind your results</b>:\u0020"</string>
    
    <string name="smokingtext">"Smoking is linked to an earlier menopause, because in late reproductive age women at a given time, smokers are more likely to be menopausal than non-smokers.
